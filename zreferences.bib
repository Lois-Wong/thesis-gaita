	abstract = {Personalized learning (PL) aspires to provide an alternative to the one-size-fits-all approach in education. Technology-based PL solutions have shown notable effectiveness in enhancing learning performance. However, their alignment with the broader goals of modern education is inconsistent across technologies and research areas. In this paper, we examine the characteristics of AI-driven PL solutions in light of the OECD Learning Compass 2030 goals. Our analysis indicates a gap between the objectives of modern education and the current direction of PL. We identify areas where most present-day PL technologies could better embrace essential elements of contemporary education, such as collaboration, cognitive engagement, and the development of general competencies. While the present PL solutions are instrumental in aiding learning processes, the PL envisioned by educational experts extends beyond simple technological tools and requires a holistic change in the educational system. Finally, we explore the potential of large language models, such as ChatGPT, and propose a hybrid model that blends artificial intelligence with a collaborative, teacher-facilitated approach to personalized learning.},

	abstract = {Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) have significantly enhanced educational accessibility by offering a wide variety of courses and breaking down traditional barriers related to geography, finance, and time. However, students often face difficulties navigating the vast selection of courses, especially when exploring new fields of study. Driven by this challenge, researchers have been exploring course recommender systems to offer tailored guidance that aligns with individual learning preferences and career aspirations. These systems face particular challenges in effectively addressing the ``cold start'' problem for new users. Recent advancements in recommender systems suggest integrating large language models (LLMs) into the recommendation process to enhance personalized recommendations and address the ``cold start'' problem. Motivated by these advancements, our study introduces RAMO (Retrieval-Augmented Generation for MOOCs), a system specifically designed to overcome the ``cold start'' challenges of traditional course recommender systems. The RAMO system leverages the capabilities of LLMs, along with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-facilitated contextual understanding, to provide course recommendations through a conversational interface, aiming to enhance the e-learning experience.},

	abstract = {Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) are playing a key role in improving educational ways. Abundant learning resources make it difficult for online users to find suitable learning content. The current personalized service in the field of online education relies more on course recommendations. However, coarse-grained recommendations cannot help users discover the defects of their knowledge network effectively. In this paper, we propose a Knowledge-Aware Meta-Concept (KAMC) framework to provide fine-grained recommendation services. We innovatively incorporate Knowledge Graph (KG) into the field of educational recommendation to provide abundant auxiliary information. However, simply combining knowledge graphs with educational recommender systems cannot improve the performance of existing recommendation models, and may even weaken the performance of the models. Because the modeled KG ignores the enhancements on the user side and only considers the enhancements on the item side. We further propose to enrich the semantic representation of users with collaborative information in user-item interactions, and at the same time enrich the semantic representation of items with information in KG. Furthermore, to provide users with more accurate and fine-grained personalized recommendation services, we propose a user-based attention mechanism to capture users’ fine-grained semantic information. Our method is experimentally validated on three real-world datasets. In the three datasets, KAMC’s AUC evaluation index is \$\$6.2{\textbackslash}\%\$\$, \$\$6.9{\textbackslash}\%\$\$, and \$\$2.2{\textbackslash}\%\$\$higher than the latest baseline method (KGAN), respectively. Experimental results show that the KAMC method outperforms the current state-of-the-art baseline methods.},

	abstract = {Online learning environments (OLE) including learning management systems (LMS) and massive open online courses (MOOCs) are gaining popularity as the best modern alternate solutions available for education in the current era. The luxury to learn irrespective of geographical and temporal restrictions makes it an attractive resource. At the start of 2020, the global pandemic enforced social distance practice worldwide, changing the work environment dynamics, leaving options like online trading, work from home, and online education. Online learning environments gained particular attention in the educational sector, where users could access the online learning resources to fulfil their academic requirements during the lockdown. From massively available content such as MOOC, learners are overwhelmed with the available choices. In this scenario, recommender systems (RS) come to the rescue to help the learner make appropriate choices for completing the enrolled course. There is tremendous scope and a multitude of opportunities available for researchers to focus on this domain. An exhaustive analysis is required to spotlight the opportunities in this realm. Various studies have been performed to provide such solutions in multiple areas of the MOOC recommendation systems (MOOCRS) such as course recommendation, learner peer recommendation, resource recommendations, to name a few. This is a compendious study into the research conducted in this area, identifying 670 articles out of 116 selected for analysis published from 2013 to 2021. It also highlights multiple areas in MOOC, where the recommendation is required, as well as technologies used by other researchers to provide solutions over time.},

Those who support teaching and learning activities, particularly, have gained increasing attention in the past years. This growing interest has motivated the emergence of new approaches and models in the field, in spite of it, there is a gap in literature about the current trends on how recommendations have been produced, how recommenders have been evaluated as well as what are the research limitations and opportunities for advancement in the field. In this regard, this paper reports the main findings of a systematic literature review covering these four dimensions. The study is based on the analysis of a set of primary studies (N = 16 out of 756, published from 2015 to 2020) included according to defined criteria. Results indicate that the hybrid approach has been the leading strategy for recommendation production. Concerning the purpose of the evaluation, the recommenders were evaluated mainly regarding the quality of accuracy and a reduced number of studies were found that investigated their pedagogical effectiveness. This evidence points to a potential research opportunity for the development of multidimensional evaluation frameworks that effectively support the verification of the impact of recommendations on the teaching and learning process. Also, we identify and discuss main limitations to clarify current difficulties that demand attention for future research.},

	abstract = {Despite the voluminous evidence in support of the paradoxical finding that providing individuals with more options can be detrimental to choice, the question of whether and when large assortments impede choice remains open. Even though extant research has identified a variety of antecedents and consequences of choice overload, the findings of the individual studies fail to come together into a cohesive understanding of when large assortments can benefit choice and when they can be detrimental to choice. In a meta-analysis of 99 observations (N=7202) reported by prior research, we identify four key factors—choice set complexity, decision task difficulty, preference uncertainty, and decision goal—that moderate the impact of assortment size on choice overload. We further show that each of these four factors has a reliable and significant impact on choice overload, whereby higher levels of decision task difficulty, greater choice set complexity, higher preference uncertainty, and a more prominent, effort-minimizing goal facilitate choice overload. We also find that four of the measures of choice overload used in prior research—satisfaction/confidence, regret, choice deferral, and switching likelihood—are equally powerful measures of choice overload and can be used interchangeably. Finally, we document that when moderating variables are taken into account the overall effect of assortment size on choice overload is significant—a finding counter to the data reported by prior meta-analytic research.},

	abstract = {Online learning is one of the most important technological breakthroughs in the 21st century. Online learning programs are rapidly evolving in line with the Internet. As part of this development, innovations that were only ideas in the past, are now becoming a reality. One of them is the idea of MOOC (Massive Open Online Course). MOOCs are built on the dynamics of engaging hundreds of thousands of students who self-organize their participation according to their learning skills, goals, prior knowledge and common interests. More and more people are participating in the learning process with MOOC courses, as they offer autonomy, energy and self-regulation of the trainees. In general, internet technologies have created many learning opportunities and are leading to various new learning models, which are evolving and changing, according to learning needs. In this paper we study the philosophy and characteristics of MOOCs, the learning theories on which they are based, the key elements of successful MOOCs as well as the principles on which they are designed and developed. MOOCs as a term came to the fore in 2008 by Stephen Downes and George Siemens and fall into two broad categories: xMOOCs that follow the behavioral model of learning approach and cMOOCs that emphasize social networking as well as their own contributions participants. In conclusion, MOOCs increase participation in lifelong learning and collaborative techniques, provide open, equal, quality and free training and are offered either for personal development or to meet job requirements, according to the individual needs of each.},

	abstract = {Internet and Communication Technologies are transforming education, taking it out of the traditional classroom and making it open, affordable and dynamic. Universities, publishers, corporates and individual lecturers are creating online courses. A course consists of video lectures, electronic study notes, online tests and assignments. Anyone who wishes to learn may enroll in these courses, take the lessons, complete the tests and assignments, and receive a certificate upon successful completion of the course. These Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) are making world class higher education available to all those who wish to learn, regardless of age, location or educational background. Education faces a number of challenges worldwide. Over 366 million youth are unenrolled in colleges. College education is growing more expensive. Many institutions face shortage of qualified faculty members, funding and infrastructure. Education over the internet can address many of these issues. Online classes are scaleable – a class of 50 can be expanded to teach 50,000. Teaching and learning over the internet can be done at a fraction of the cost of traditional classroom teaching. Flexibility, mobility, use of multimedia technologies, constant syllabus revision, collaboration and interactive discussions give online education an advantage. This is still an evolving field. New partnerships, innovations and technological advances are revolution­ izing teaching and learning, and clearly, online education is an integral part of the future of education.},

	abstract = {AI chatbots and telemedicine are revolutionizing cancer care by providing support to patients and enhancing communication between them and their healthcare providers. AI chatbots use natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning to engage with patients, offering tailored information, emotional support, and assistance in managing treatment plans. For example, they can explain complex medical information, help monitor symptoms, and provide reminders for medication adherence, making patients feel more informed and involved in their care. Telemedicine complements AI chatbots by allowing patients to connect with their healthcare providers remotely, eliminating geographical barriers and reducing the need for frequent hospital visits. This is particularly beneficial for cancer patients who require ongoing monitoring and follow-up care. Through virtual consultations, patients can discuss treatment progress, report side effects, and adjust care plans as needed, fostering a collaborative approach to care. The integration of AI chatbots and telemedicine enhances communication by facilitating a continuous and accessible support system. Patients can access information and guidance at any time, reducing anxiety and improving their overall experience. Additionally, healthcare providers can use data collected through chatbots and telemedicine platforms to make informed, timely decisions about patient care. Together, AI chatbots and telemedicine offer a more efficient, patient-centered approach to cancer care, ultimately improving outcomes and quality of life.},

	abstract = {This paper on artificial intelligence in education (AIEd) has two aims. The first: to explain to a non-specialist, interested, reader what AIEd is: its goals, how it is built, and how it works. The second: to set out the argument for what AIEd can offer teaching and learning, both now and in the future, with an eye towards improving learning and life outcomes for all. Computer systems that are artificially intelligent interact with the world using capabilities (such as speech recognition) and intelligent behaviours (such as using available information to take the most sensible actions toward a stated goal) that we would think of as essentially human. At the heart of artificial intelligence in education is the scientific goal to make knowledge, which is often left implicit, computationally precise and explicit. In other words, in addition to being the engine behind much ‘smart’ ed tech, AIEd is also designed to be a powerful tool to open up what is sometimes called the ‘black box of learning,’ giving us more fine-grained understandings of how learning actually happens. Although some might find the concept of AIEd alienating, the algorithms and models that underpin ed tech powered by AIEd form the basis of an essentially human endeavor. Using AIEd, teachers will be able to offer learners educational experiences that are more personalised, flexible, inclusive and engaging. Crucially, we do not see a future in which AIEd replaces teachers. What we do see is a future in which the extraordinary expertise of teachers is better leveraged and augmented through the thoughtful deployment of well designed AIEd. We have available, right now, AIEd tools that could support student learning at a scale previously unimaginable by providing one-on-one tutoring to every student, in every subject. Existing technologies also have the capacity to provide intelligent support to learners working in a group, and to create authentic virtual learning environments where students have the right support, at the right time, to tackle real-life problems and puzzles. In the near future, we expect that teaching and learning will increasingly be supported by the thoughtful application of AIEd tools. For example, by lifelong learning companions powered by AI that can accompany and support individual learners throughout their studies - in and beyond school - and new forms of assessment that measure learning while it is taking place, shaping the learning experience in real time. If we are ultimately successful, we predict that AIEd will help us address some of the most intractable problems in education, including achievement gaps and teacher retention. AIEd will also help us respond to the most significant social challenge that AI has already brought - the steady replacement of jobs and occupations with clever algorithms and robots. It is our view that this provides a new innovation imperative in education, which can be expressed simply: as humans live and work alongside increasingly smart machines, our education systems will need to achieve at levels that none have managed to date. True progress will require the development of an AIEd infrastructure. This will not, however, be a single monolithic AIEd system. Instead, it will resemble the marketplace that has developed for smartphone apps: hundreds and then thousands of individual AIEd components, developed in collaboration with educators, conformed to uniform international data standards, and shared with researchers and developers worldwide. These standards will also enable system-level data collation and analysis that will help us to learn much more about learning itself – and how to improve it. Moving forward, we will need to pay close attention to three powerful forces as we map the future of artificial intelligence in education, namely pedagogy, technology, and system change. Paying attention to the pedagogy will mean that the design of new edtech should always start with what we know about learning. It also means that the system for funding this work must be simultaneously opened up and refocused, moving away from isolated pockets of R\&D and toward collaborative enterprises that prioritise areas known to make a real difference to teaching and learning. Paying attention to the technology will mean creating smarter demand for commercial grade AIEd products that work. It also means the development of a robust, component-based AIEd infrastructure, similar to the smartphone app marketplace, where researchers and developers can access standardised components that have been developed in collaboration with educators. Paying attention to system change will mean involving teachers, students, and parents in co-designing new tools, so that AIEd will appropriately address the inherent “messiness” of real classroom, university, and workplace learning environments. It also means the development of data standards that promote the safe and ethical use of data. Said succinctly, we need intelligent technologies that embody what we know about great teaching and learning, embodied in enticing consumer grade products, which are then used effectively in real-life settings that combine the best of human and machine. We do not underestimate the new-thinking, inevitable wrong-turns, and effort required to realise these recommendations. However, if we are to properly unleash the intelligence of AIEd, we must do things differently - via new collaborations, sensible funding, and (always) a keen eye on the pedagogy. The potential prize is too great to act otherwise.},

	abstract = {In the coming decades, as the pace of technological change continues to increase, millions of workers may need to be not just upskilled but re skilled—a profoundly complex societal challenge that will sometimes require workers to both acquire new skills and change occupations entirely. Companies have a critical role to play in addressing this challenge, but to date few have taken it seriously. To learn more about what their role will entail, the authors—members of a collaboration between the Digital Data Design Institute at Harvard’s Digital Reskilling Lab and the Boston Consulting Group’s Henderson Institute—interviewed leaders at some 40 organizations around the world that are investing in large-scale reskilling programs. In synthesizing what they learned, they became aware of five paradigm shifts that are emerging in reskilling: (1) Reskilling is a strategic imperative. (2) It is the responsibility of every leader and manager. (3) It is a change-management initiative. (4) Employees want to reskill—when it makes sense. (5) It takes a village. The authors argue that companies will need to understand and embrace these shifts if they hope to succeed in adapting dynamically to the rapidly evolving new era of automation and AI.},

	abstract = {A systematic search of the research literature from 1996 through July 2008 identified more than a thousand empirical studies of online learning. Analysts screened these studies to find those that (a) contrasted an online to a face-to-face condition, (b) measured student learning outcomes, (c) used a rigorous research design, and (d) provided adequate information to calculate an effect size. As a result of this screening, 51 independent effects were identified that could be subjected to meta-analysis. The meta-analysis found that, on average, students in online learning conditions performed better than those receiving face-to-face instruction. The difference between student outcomes for online and face-to-face classes--measured as the difference between treatment and control means, divided by the pooled standard deviation--was larger in those studies contrasting conditions that blended elements of online and face-to-face instruction with conditions taught entirely face-to-face. Analysts noted that these blended conditions often included additional learning time and instructional elements not received by students in control conditions. This finding suggests that the positive effects associated with blended learning should not be attributed to the media, per se. An unexpected finding was the small number of rigorous published studies contrasting online and face-to-face learning conditions for K-12 students. In light of this small corpus, caution is required in generalizing to the K-12 population because the results are derived for the most part from studies in other settings (e.g., medical training, higher education).
