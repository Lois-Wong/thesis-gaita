\section{Introduction}
The growing demand for technical skills has led many learners to open-access courseware platforms like Coursera and edX. While these platforms offer a wealth of quality educational content, they also present challenges, such as navigating a vast selection of courses, identifying those that align with individual goals, and understanding prerequisite requirements. 

This leads to choice overload, where too many options and insufficient guidance result in frustration and poor learning outcomes. Existing recommendation systems rely on vanilla algorithms that prioritize popular courses or basic keyword matching, and fail to capture the unique needs and diverse backgrounds of learners. Recent advancements in AI, particularly through Large Language Models (LLMs) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), offer new opportunities to address these challenges. By providing more dynamic and context-aware recommendations, these models can create personalized experiences. 

This chapter explores the obstacles faced by self-learners, the limitations of existing recommendation systems, and how LLMs can reshape personalized learning. It also identifies the key features of an effective system and the remaining gaps in current solutions.

\section{AI is Changing Every Field} 

Advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI) are transforming a wide range of industries \cite{nature:2023} and driving the demand for technical skills and Computer Science knowledge \cite{tamayo:2023}. From healthcare \cite{saxena:2024} to education \cite{luckin:2016} and creative industries \cite{almamari:2024}, AI is enabling new innovations that require expertise in areas such as Data Science, Machine Learning, and Software Development. In sectors like healthcare, AI is being used to analyze large datasets, improve diagnostic accuracy \cite{lenharo:2023}, and enhance patient care \cite{ranjbar:2024}. Similarly, in finance, AI-powered algorithms are automating fraud detection and risk assessment \cite{shabir:2024}. These developments demonstrate the expanding influence of AI and highlight the increasing need for professionals with a strong technical foundation.

As technical skills become increasingly essential across diverse fields, the demand for Computer Science knowledge has surged \cite{bls:2024}, leading both college students and professionals from other disciplines to pursue learning in these areas. This influx of learners from various backgrounds introduces the additional challenge in finding appropriate and relevant educational resources.
