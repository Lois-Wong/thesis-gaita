I would like to express my gratitude to those who have supported me throughout the development of this project. Thank you to Ram Kripa for his assistance with coding, deployment, and troubleshooting throughout the project. I would also like to thank Amanda Ferber for her help with creating the database that underlies the recommendation system. 

Finally, I am grateful to my family for their support and encouragement through my own educational journey and transition into the field of Computer Science, and to Professors David Yarowsky and Joshua Reiter for their guidance and insight throughout my academic journey.
